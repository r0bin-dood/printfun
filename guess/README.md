# guess

`guess` is a simple number guessing game implemented in a single printf call. The program generates a random number between 0 and N, and players must guess the correct number to win. While the upper limit is set to 10 by default, this can be adjusted by modifying the code and recompiling.

## Building

`make guess`

or if you want to build all the programs in the `printfun` project

`make all`

## Usage

`./build/guess`

You can exit early with `Ctrl + C`
