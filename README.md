# printfun: A Collection of Absurd printf Programs

`printf` is traditionally used for printing, but what if it could do... more? `printfun` is a series of C programs that push the boundaries of what can be achieved with a single `printf` call. Whether it's a game, a server, or a simple utility, `printfun` aims to implement entire programs in one `printf` statement.

Note: While `printfun` isn't about obfuscation, some level of complexity is inevitable when packing all functionality into a single line.

## Building

You can build each program individually with:

`make <program_name>`

or build all of them with:

`make all`

All the binaries will be inside the `build/` directory.

## Programs

Each program in `printfun` is stored in its own folder and comes with a README file. These README files include:
- A quick description of what the program does.
- Instructions specific to each program.
- Guidance on running and using the program.
